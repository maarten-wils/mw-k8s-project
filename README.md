Kubernetes Web Stack – Linux Web & Network Services

This project implements a 3-tier web application (Apache – FastAPI – PostgreSQL) containerized with Docker and deployed on a multi-node Kubernetes cluster using kind. The stack is exposed through an NGINX Ingress and includes health checks (liveness, readiness probes), scaling and load-balancing.

The application demonstrates practical knowledge of Docker, Kubernetes deployments and services, ingress routing, scaling, and cluster management as required for the Linux Web & Network Services exam.
